First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!  

## There are many ways to contribute:

### Found a bug?
Open an issue, where you describe the bug and explain how it occurred.  
There are some straightforward issue templates, choose one that fits your needs.

### Have any ideas or suggestions?
Open an issue, where you describe it.  
Or you can directly open a pull request with your idea done.

### Pull Request
Do you want to fix a bug or add a feature?  
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork, and make your changes
3. Commit and push your changes
4. Open a Pull Request with the changes you made

## Some important things
* If you fork the repo and want to add changes, creating a new branch for it is optional.  
* You can find the API documentation [HERE](docs/API.md). If you added a new endpoint to the backend, you should update the docs as well. :)
